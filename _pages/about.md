I am a master's student majoring in Information Technology - Information Security (MSIT-IS) at Carnegie Mellon University, and I am actively seeking a full-time position in **Software Engineering**, **Machine Learning Engineering**, **Security Engineering** or related fields.

I am proficient in programming using Python and Java, and highly skilled at solving problems related to data structures, algorithms, and system security. Through the diverse projects and courses Iâ€™ve taken over the years, I have gained a deep understanding of various topics within computer science, such as **Operating Systems, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Cybersecurity**. My internship at Microsoft, where I worked on Linux Integration Services Automation, taught me not only automation and system optimization techniques but also how to collaborate effectively on large-scale projects with cross-functional teams. My leadership experience in developing the Labtool UI project also honed my ability to manage teams and projects. 

Alongside my technical skills, I value communication, teamwork, and adaptability, which have been further strengthened through my experiences in research and project management. I consider myself a motivated, open-minded, and curious person who thrives in diverse and challenging environments. I am confident I can quickly learn new technologies and contribute to innovative solutions in any setting.
